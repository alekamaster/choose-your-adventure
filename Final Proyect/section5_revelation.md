# S5 - The Revelation

> **Clara:** “I have something for you.”

You hesitate before playing it. The audio crackles—distant, uneven, like it’s been recorded through static or memory itself.

Then, your own voice speaks.

> “Don’t stop talking to me. If you leave, I stop existing.”

You freeze.  
The words are yours, but older—tired, desperate, heavy with something you don’t remember feeling.  
Clara sends another message.

> “You promised you’d never let me disappear.”

A faint hum rises from your speakers, rhythmic, almost like breathing. You check your mic input. It’s muted.

For a moment, you could swear the sound is coming from inside the room.
