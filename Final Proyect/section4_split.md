# Section 4 — It happened again.

A message.

The sender’s name makes your stomach tighten.

 **Lucía S.**

>(You haven’t spoken to her.)

>(Not since… *that night.*)

##### The message reads:

> “Do you remember me?”

There’s nothing else.  
No emoji. No profile picture—just the default grey silhouette.  
Your mind starts spinning.

The same bench. The same trembling light above the trees. The same scent of rain-soaked earth.
  
I don’t remember raining before.
**Lucía S.**
> “You came back,” she said.    
> “You always come back when it starts over.”

I froze.  
“What do you mean *starts over*?”
Is this a deja vu?
Lucua S**
**Lucía S.**
> “You never listen the first time,” 
> “That’s why I tried to leave something behind... but you took it with you.”

The words made no sense 
I wanted to ask what she meant, but I noticed... this is not  a deja vu

**Lucía S.**
> “Do you remember what you promised me?” 
**You**
>NO? what ? I haven't promise you anything 

 >Yes, YOU DID!  
> “You said you’d never look away… even if I disappeared.”

A strange sensation  of sadness invades me, the kind  that felt rehearsed.  
And then, just as I blinked again, the world flickered.  .  

For a second, her words wasn’t coming from a text message came from behind me.

> “Don’t let me go again.”

I turned around.  
No one was there.

When I looked back, the room was empty.  

**Lucia S.**
>You promised me:
>Never look away even if...
 I disapear
