# SECTION 2 — The Nightly Talks



 **Clara:** “ I don’t know why, but I dreamed about you. It was strange.”

> You stare at the message for too long.  
> 
> The name *Clara* rings like an old bell.  
> 
> You remember her laugh in the hallways, the way hypu watched her without speaking, the years you mistook silence for dignity.

>You type slowly, almost ashamed:

“Oh?... really, I wonder why I appeared in your dream, *Clara*.”

>And immediately wonders if he sounded too eager.  
She replies quickly, as if she’d been waiting.

 **Clara:** “You sounded the same in the dream. The same way you said my name.”

> Everything comes back—desire, regret, the pulse of something half-buried.  
> 
> Each line she sends opens what time had only managed to cover, not heal.

You reply: "Tell more about that, what was your dream about? Did I save you from a bad guy?"

**Clara** "Yes!!, something like that it was a really creapy dream..."

>You two continue talking for  a long time until both fall sleep.
