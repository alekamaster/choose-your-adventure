# S5 - I forgot about it...

> *Clara’s typing tone,* her responses feel oddly delayed, like someone typing from far away.

**Clara:**
>I miss you, since that day...i have been tryging to reach out to you.

>I have been observing you 

#### You can feel a heavy atmospheare and a heavy tone on his words.. ####
**You:**

>I never wanted to leave you

#### Your fingers trembles between the words, like the signal of his presesnce is breaking.

> “But I had to keep moving. I couldn’t stay stuck in that night forever.”

**Clara:**

>You shouldn’t have

#### The tone isn’t angry—just hollow, as if every sound were leaking out of her ####
 **You:**
 >I’ve been trying to reach you. To get close again. I’ve watched you. I’ve seen you. And every time I did, I realized something terrible.”

 #### !The screen flickers once! #### 

“Everything you promised me,” she whispers, “was a lie.”

Silence follows. Not digital silence, but the kind that presses against your ears until you feel it in your chest.
