# S6 - The Promise Kept



#### The cursor blinks. The room feels smaller. Every sound—the hum of the fan, the faint crackle in the speakers—seems too close ####  
> ##### Her messages fill the screen faster now, one after another, spilling like static

**Clara:**
> “You said you’d never leave me.”  
> “You said we’d always be connected.”  
> “You broke it. You broke *me*.”

**(You type back, fingers shaking):**

> “Clara… I didn’t know. I thought you were gone.”

No reply...

##### Just a low hiss through your headphones, like someone breathing on the other end. #####

## Then: ##

**Clara:**
> “I was never gone. You just stopped looking.”

#### The lights flicker. Your reflection in the monitor isn’t yours anymore—her eyes stare back, wet, glassy, pleading. #####

The screen goes black.

Then, a final message appears—white letters on darkness.

> “It’s your turn to keep the promise.”

You try to pull away, but the screen flares open again, blinding white. The hum grows louder until it becomes a scream, then—

Silence.

The monitor shows the chat window again.  
Your name at the top.  
Status: **Online.**  
The typing bubble moves.

> **Clara:** “Hey. I just wanted to talk for a bit. Can we?”
