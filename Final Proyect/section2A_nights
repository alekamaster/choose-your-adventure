# Introspection 



>You answer carefully:  
“I’m not sure… do we know each other?”

Her response comes instantly.  
> **Clara:** “Yes. You used to tell me you hated Mondays, and that coffee tasted better when we talked.”

That could’ve been anyone. Or someone who truly knew you.  
You search for mind—blurred images, laughter without faces.  
Something about how she remembers so much while he remembers nothing feels wrong.  
Like she kept the memories he lost.

 Everything comes back—desire, regret, the pulse of something half-buried.  
***You tried to remember but for some reason you can't, you know her, you can feel it, but she gives you a bad feeling for some reason*** 
> Each line she sends opens what time had only managed to cover, not heal.

The name means nothing.  
No face, no memory, no echo of familiarity. Maybe a forgotten contact, maybe someone from another life online.


**Clara** I don’t know why, but I dreamed about you. It was strange, it was a really creapy dream...
