# Ecos of the Chat  
## S 1 – The First Message

**Scene Description**

You’re home alone. The screen glows faintly against the dark. It’s late—later than it should be.  
You were about to shut down your laptop when a notification sound breaks the silence.

A message.

The sender’s name makes your stomach tighten.

 **Clara.**

>You haven’t spoken to her in years. Not since high school.  
Not since… *that night.*

##### The message reads:

> “Do you remember me?”

There’s nothing else.  
No emoji. No profile picture—just the default grey silhouette.  
Your mind starts spinning. Curiosity fights with unease. You tell yourself it’s probably nothing.  
Still, your hand hovers over the keyboard.

###  Choices

1. **Reply right away**  
   [_“Sure, it’s been a while...”_](/Final%20Proyect/section2_nights.md)  
   > *Lucía’s typing tone,* her responses feel oddly delayed, like someone typing from far away.

2. **Ignore it** 

   [The screen stays silent for a minute… then another message arrives: ](/Final%20Proyect/section3A_confession.md)
     > “You always ignore things you don’t want to remember.”
